                        <p>Fakir Chand College at Diamond Harbour, West Bengal, India, is a liberal Arts, Science and

                            Fakir Chand College has remained a cornerstone of education in this remote corner of West
                            Bengal. The Institution boasts of a 74-year-old heritage imparting education to the largest
                            number of students in the district. The salubrious climate and scenic beauty of the place
                            located at the confluence of the River Hooghly and the Bay of Bengal provide an ideal
                            ambience
                            conducive to the pursuit of higher education. Public transport arrangements are capable of
                            meeting the needs of the students.

                        <p>Fakir Chand College stands today at Diamond Harbour in the southern part of West Bengal. It
                            is
                            the culmination of the vision of one person to bring higher education facilities to the
                            people
                            of this area. About 100 kilometres (62 mi) from south to north, there was no college before
                            Independence. The academically-inclined would have to travel to Kolkata. This was a
                            difficult
                            proposition, physically and financially, for many.



                            Under the leadership of Dr. Subires Bhattacharyya (who joined in April 2005), the College
                            was
                            accredited by the NAAC and the NCTE, and four postgraduate courses have been introduced.
                            Several
                            UGC-sponsored seminars have also been organised. The College now has 19 undergraduate
                            courses
                            (General and Honours) in Arts, Science and Commerce, a teacher-training course (B. Ed.) and
                            five
                            postgraduate (M.A., M.Sc. and M.Com.) courses in Bengali, History, Education, Pure
                            Mathematics
                            and Commerce. An eye remains on the economic and social exigencies in the introduction and
                            conduct of courses. University results in different streams are quite satisfactory, and a
                            good
                            number of students are admitted regularly to the various postgraduate courses under Calcutta
                            University and other institutions of higher learning. Educational excursions and field trips
                            are
                            arranged on regular basis.

                        <p>Vision :-
                            The Institution envisions the real emancipation of human beings by developing the inner
                            faculties of the students and by making them believe in themselves. The Institution believes
                            that attaining only a university degree is not the actual goal of education, rather
                            “Education
                            is the manifestation of perfection already in man” as opined by Swami Vivekananda. The
                            Institution is committed to encouraging the all-around development of the students. As
                            Mahatma
                            Gandhi had said, “Education is the all-round development of body, mind and soul.”

                            Mission :-
                            The mission of the College is “Light, More Light”, inspired by the Peace Mantra Asato Ma
                            Sadgamaya, Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya (From ignorance, lead me to truth; from darkness, lead me
                            to
                            light), that is, to impart knowledge to every individual, irrespective of his/her religious
                            or
                            economic status. It aims to disseminate knowledge to the remotest corner of the district and
                            to
                            the poorest of the poor. A holistic approach constitutes the watchword of the Institution’s
                            endeavour to make higher education available to diverse sections of Indian society. Students
                            here are motivated not only to strive for intellectual excellence, but to also equip
                            themselves
                            to meet the challenges posed by modern society. They are ably guided towards this goal by
                            the
                            teachers of the College who remain unfailing in their academic commitment and sincerity.</p>
